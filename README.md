Ball Falling Game

Description:
This is a simple JavaScript game, my first game project. I learned a better use of JS and CSS while making this project. Hope you all like it.

Reasons for choosing this Project:
I chose this Project because Software built games are the integral part of modern era and having a hands-on experience in making even a small game can be very helpful in enhancing knowledge and boosting confidence. That too, if many of the games can be created using JS, HTML and CSS. Then, Why not ??

Tech Stacks:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
